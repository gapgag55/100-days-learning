# 100-days-learning

## Day 1 - Image classification with Mobilenet
**What I learnt:** 
1. Supervised learning is related to bunch of datasets which given to the system to learning
2. Mobilenet is a set of models of algorithms for Machine Learning
3. P5-manager is a tool for ease-of-use workflow
4. Tensorflow.js is a library on top of Tensorflow which interprets only python to c++
5. ML5 is a library on top of Tensorflow.js
