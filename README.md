# 100-days-learning

## Day 1 - July 17, 2019

**Topic:** 
Machine Learning with ML5.js

**What have I learnt:** 
1. Supervised learning is related to bunch of datasets which given to the system to learning
2. Mobilenet is a set of models of algorithms for Machine Learning
3. P5-manager is a tool for ease of workflow
4. Tensorflow.js is a library on top of Tensorflow which interprets only python to c++
5. ML5 is a library on top of Tensorflow.js
6. Feature Extractor is the process to extract the feature from the input such as image or video into the number combined with ML algorithm become the classifier model

**Result:**
1. [Image Classification](https://github.com/gapgag55/100-days-learning/tree/master/image-classification)
2. [Webcam Image Classification](https://github.com/gapgag55/100-days-learning/tree/master/webcam-image-classification)
3. [Feature Extractor Classification](https://github.com/gapgag55/100-days-learning/tree/master/feature-extractor-classification)

## Day 2 - July 18, 2019
**Topic:** 
Machine Learning with ML5.js (Cont.)

**What have I learnt:** 
1. In classification of feature extraction ML5.js is just classifying particular image with specific label
2. In regression of feature extraction ML5.js releated to assign the number to particular image as the label

**Result:**
1. [ML5.js: Feature Extractor Regression]()
